Title: Back to reality 2007

I'm also back. I laughed when the pilot said that it was raining in Schiphol. Looked outside the windows and everything was gray. Here we go again...

I spent most of the last 3 weeks sitting on the sand. I think I still have sand in my butt. I made tomato jam, roasted paprika with garlic (nice harvest in my dad's yard), installed an irrigation system in my moms trees (they were dying), took my dad to the doctor (he's that stubborn), taught my dog to sit in the trunk of the car without leaping forward and to walk by my side without a leech (doesn't work with other dogs in sight), cut the palm leaves from my uncles garden (only got stung once), got a tan without getting sun burn (I don't remember last time that happened), took some stuff to read and never made it to the 5th page (I'm so proud!), hooked up the internet seldom enough to have to read through 60 buities emails, made a 60+ year old friend who is a painter, kept my belly in a respectable size with Portuguese beer, fish and pig meat. But mostly I sat my ass on the sand.
