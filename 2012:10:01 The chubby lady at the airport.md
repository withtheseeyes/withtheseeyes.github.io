Title: The chubby lady at the airport
Date: 2012/10/01 13:09

I was walking in the train station of Brussels, when I noticed this short chubby lady with a large yellow backpack, walking in a hurry down the corridor, with her bright eyes wide open. It was a bit stressful to see that image. Her expression was of burden, undoubtably blaming her backpack, which was also not very happy to be strapped so tightly around this woman who persisted in swinging it wildly from side to side, rhythmically with her heavy steps. Even her pants, sad, stretched, sagging around her wait, had given up all hope of fitting properly any human being.

I was on a hurry myself but I didn't care to show it to the world. I had time and my luggage was elegantly and very happy to be rolling behind me, as if floating on air. By the time I reached the peer to catch the train to the airport, the chubby lady was already there. Now two small red roses were growing on the her cheeks, waiting for the nourishing water forming on her forehead.

The train came, i stepped in, the crazy Belgium conductor told me I had to pay him 2 euros but it was not for his company, it was for someone else, who was working on the accesses to the airport, the train stopped, i stepped out, climbed the endless escalators to the terminal and searched for my check-in desk. It was at the end of the terminal, I was flying on a cheap airline and those always get put in the farthest end of places. So I proceeded, always checking the screens to be sure I was on the right way. Suddenly, a familiar image caught my eye, the yellow backpack alternating from one side to the other around the chubby lady. There she was again, in all her furry and determination of hurrying up. This time, I barely had time to pick anything new, she was swiftly gone behind me.

I was the third inline, the checking wasn't even open. Quickly the queue behind me grew and the pretty airline lady was busy turning on the terminals to start to check us in. She wasn't very happy with life and some luggages which got stuck in the luggage belt, tripping some loud and annoying warning alarm, found themselves, in addition to the unfamiliar situation of being stuck and stunned by the alarm, on the receiving end of the full force of her frustrations. I'm sure those luggages, as they proceeded down the belt, trying to keep a growing wave of tears from surging out, hugging each other for comfort, were not going to ge stuck anymore in their lives.

After checking in, I decided to investigate the appealing advertisement of a pizza place. One of the those selling nice crunchy pizzas, totally fake and insulting to the average Italian person, yet unreasonably tasty, being sold for some irrelevant amount of money. It was still 11:30 but my belly was effective and swift to undermine the philosophical grounds of that argument. The pizza place was situated in a food hall, with a couple other places, which, with the permission of my belly, I decided to be sure were not providing more appealing nourishment. It turned out to be mostly empty or closed, only a another place selling croissants, which would be perfect two hours before. So I turned back and watched in horror as a group of people all dressed the same, were walking from my right on the general direction of my two nice slices of pizza and my cool Belgium beer. My brain, helped by my belly, quickly compute that I could never reach the pizza place and order before them, so my belly decided to believe they would just keep on walking and go on with their thus eliminating the otherwise crucial need to jump over the tables commando-style to reach there first. They didn't. They wanted to have lunch and they were taking all the pizza that was ready to take, so I had to wait for a new pizza, on top of the time it would take the one waiter to get done with them. I convinced my belly that it was not worth it. I was a bit early too.

So I returned to the endless walk towards my boarding gate, sometimes through endless straight levelled corridors with those rolling floors, where some people decide it makes sense to stand and wait for the thing to carry you all the way to the end, other time through a winding succession of shopping floors and stairs. Reaching the top, I felt accomplished, the sun light was coming in through the glass ceiling, the signs said I have to go through some corridor, instinctively I realised I was almost near my gate. Then I saw a coffee place and decided to stop and savour the end of my endeavour.

As I am I walking towards it, I notice a number of comfortable chairs, sort of those reclined one with a place to rest your legs. I also notice the chubby lady sitting in one of them, holding a huge chocolate bar, looking at it in a creepy predatorial way. I get my coffee and purposely sit facing towards her, a couple of rows away. It was also the best spot, near the edge overlooking the floor below, under the sun and free of people in the vicinity. By the time I sit down, her mouth was finishing chewing but her eyes continued to enjoy the chocolate. She was chubby in the formal sense of the word. Double chin, voluptuous cheeks, round face. Her soft short pitch-black hair was designed to help her head get rid of the excess heat of her weight. Her neck was in a fight with the colar of her shirt, I figured they never got along. She had sweet eyes and she paid attention to the world because she had clearly spotted my intrusive diagnosis. More important things were on her mind, since that didn't bother her for long. She skilfully reached for her backpack and produced the chocolate bar I saw before. It was half gone and the other half knew it didn't have much time left. Her chubby finger nimbly retrieved and piece and her eyes were happy again.
