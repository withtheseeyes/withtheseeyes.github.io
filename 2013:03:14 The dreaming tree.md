Title: The dreaming tree

When I was a kid, my parents decided that I should not spend so much time in a flat in the big city. They bought this old house up in the mountains, it took them forever to renovate it. I remember the feeling of visiting it and noticing something was getting built and fixed. It gave me this sense that there is a purpose in what people do and as a result useful things get put up together. Fruitfulness, I probably learned about that by looking at a house being built.

It was on the lower side of the street, something that my grand father, who knew a thing or two about houses, did not approve too much. Later, my parents would buy the house where I went through my teenage years and that one was too on the lower side of the street. That one would too be the target of my grand father's disapproval, later my mother told me. There's nothing wrong with a house on the lower side of the street, really. It's just where the dirty water on the street flows to and you need to take care that you there's enough drainage and other expensive stuff to stop it from coming in. I guess that was the reason my grand father disliked it, he was rarely wrong about that sort of thing. Still, the house in the mountains didn't have any problem, probably because he was going there once in a while and speaking to my father about it.

There was always mist there. Fluffy chunks of cotton kept around, they liked to play in that valley, covering the sun and letting the cold air fill everything. It was cold there sometimes, it was my first taste of felling cold. I didn't like it then, I don't like it now. The walls were covered with this soft insulation stuff, which was painted over. If you pressed the wall with your finger with enough force, you'd break the paint and punch a small hole on the wall. I had a spot behind a large closet, where I could squeeze into to conduct my experiments on punching-holes-on-the-wall, cleanly safe from punishment.

Surrounding the house was some land, which quickly became populated by apple trees. They didn't like it there, since they didn't bring us many apples and the ones they surrendered were small and bitter. In the warm days, the apples that had already fallen would smell of fermentation and decay. It sounds worse that it smells, it was actually sort of pleasant. Like those strong smells that you associate with childhood but someone else else is quick to find it repugnant. I remember it to be large patches of land, enclosed in terraces, defying the natural slope. Probably if I go there now, I realize how small it was and instead of hundreds of trees, there's only place for a dozen.

In front of the house there was a patch of grass. I would spend time there with my father, kicking a ball to him, eagerly waiting for him to kick it back at me, finally getting disappointed because he was tired and wanted to stop. Between it and the house, there was a pear tree. She liked it there, her pears were plenty and tasty. They were big and round, more like a large apple and not the sort you find in the supermarket; the skin was tough and thick, it good to keep the cold away from of the juicy inside. She was all grown up when we moved in, so her shadow over the house was welcome in the summer but not too thick to make it dark inside. I liked to climb her, I remember the first times I did it, i was pretty proud of myself. Only to the first branch, though. Later, that branch would be has high as my waist but back then it was probably the tallest thing I had ever climbed and, for that reason, worthy of my respect. My father too was surely the tallest biggest strongest man alive, I remember wondering if I would ever be like that. It all seemed so far off into the future, too far to be concerned about. Looking back, I would have been better to regard the time between then and now a little bit more seriously, it feels like it was a friend with whom I had great times but eventually I lost contact with.

One day I got tired of climbing only to the first branch. I looked up at the other branches, like I had many times before, and decided it was time to see the world from them. They seemed they didn't really want me there, they were not really easy to reach, there was a big gap between them. I would have to stretch and reach, probably even hoist myself up. Just thinking about it made me sweat. It was summer, that didn't help but my fear was surely hotter. I was not particularly afraid of heights but it felt reasonable to be afraid. A bit trembling, a bit too slowly, I managed to breach the gap. From there, it was easy to go further up, so quickly I was as high as the first floor of the house. My brain told be to not mess this up, there was the ground and many branches before it to deliver the punishment of falling. I assured I was sitting properly. I looked around, the world seemed far below, the house even smaller. My mother came out, she looked around, went around the house and back, and went back inside a bit puzzled. I didn't make a sound, I was in charge of that moment and I wanted to keep it that way. For some reason, I wouldn't climb it again that often, probably I was too young to do that stuff or having done it once was proof enough for me. Mostly I would stop at the first branch, it was more inviting and friendly than the ones above.

I returned a few times to that house, just to see it. It's a bit off the way to anywhere, so you really need to want to go there. The first times the pear tree was still there, but at some point, probably shortly after someone bought the house, they decided she was too old and made her into fire wood.
