Title: Forte o suficiente para n√£o odiar

Most of the time<br>
I'm clear focused all around,<br>
Most of the time<br>
I can keep both feet on the ground,<br>
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,<br>
Stay right with it, when the road unwinds,<br>
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,<br>
I don't even notice she's gone,<br>
Most of the time.<br>

Most of the time<br>
It's well understood,<br>
Most of the time<br>
I wouldn't change it if I could,<br>
I can't make it all match up, I can hold my own,<br>
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,<br>
I can survive, I can endure<br>
And I don't even think about her<br>
Most of the time.<br>

Most of the time<br>
My head is on straight,<br>
Most of the time<br>
I'm strong enough not to hate.<br>
I don't build up illusion 'till it makes me sick,<br>
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick<br>
I can smile in the face of mankind.<br>
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine<br>
Most of the time.<br>

Most of the time<br>
She ain't even in my mind,<br>
I wouldn't know her if I saw her<br>
She's that far behind.<br>
Most of the time<br>
I can't even be sure<br>
If she was ever with me<br>
Or if I was with her.<br>

Most of the time<br>
I'm halfway content,<br>
Most of the time<br>
I know exactly where I went,<br>
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,<br>
Hide from the feelings, that are buried inside,<br>
I don't compromised and I don't pretend,<br>
I don't even care if I ever see her again<br>
Most of the time.<br>

Bob Dylan
