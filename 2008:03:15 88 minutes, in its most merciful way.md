Title: 88 minutes, in its most merciful way
Date: 2008/03/15 00:41

Hello everyone...<br>
Jon Forrester is dead.<br>
His execution is not a cause for celebration nor is it an indication.<br>
It is a chapter in the road to justice and recovery.<br>

I personally don't believe in capital punishment<br>
I do believe in the rights of victims.<br>
I do believe that they deserve recompense,<br>
no matter how significant or insignificant it maybe<br>
in comparison to the loss suffered.<br>

I've suffered such a loss.<br>
And some of you here,<br>
I have spent those sleepless nights<br>
trying desperately to...<br>
squelch down that baling instinct for revenge.<br>

And I have wondered<br>
if this pain will... ever abate.<br>
I've learned that time doesn't heal the wound.<br>
It will, though, in its most merciful way,<br>
blunt the edge ever so slightly.<br>

So...
