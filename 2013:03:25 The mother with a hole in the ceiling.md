Title: The mother with a hole in the ceiling
Date: 2013/3/25 12:50

I arrived in Lisbon in a emigrants flight, as Dorothy called it. I was one of those cheap flights, leaving on a Friday before the Christmas week. The large men sitting in front of me, who luckily had no one sitting in the middle seat between them, particularly lucky for whoever would be sitting there - me included - were talking loudly about their other airplane flights. One was bragging about having flown "one of those airplanes with propellers", when he had to go to Poland to do some job. The others were just glad they didn't have to make the journey by truck, as it was usually the case. In front of them, there was a couple, she was grossly over-sized, he was impeccably groomed, sparkling white teeth, tanned smooth skin, carefully combed and greasy hair, both had no manners whatsoever. More civilised was their newly-born son who graciously didn't cry or otherwise rightfully complained about the flight or his fate for having such parents. As we walked out of the airplane, Dorothy remarked that you need to come to Lisbon to get some Sun in December and she was right. Quickly I realised that I didn't need to wear so much clothes, even cautiously recovering from a flu, it was clearly a better idea to wear the jacket without any woollen pullover underneath.

I said goodbye to Dorothy, we were going different ways. My ride was the subway, her's was her parents. I emerged in down-town Lisbon and walked a couple of blocks towards the house of my friend. I talked to him, he was at a meeting but his wife was at home and he told me she would like to see me. I took the chance to meet his new-born twins and catch up a bit. I followed the map towards their house in the busy streets. This part of Lisbon is a bit rough. It's quite safe but old and dirty. The white hand-set stone sidewalks separate the black messy street form the light-coloured old houses, which are not particularly old, it's just that time and people were not kind to them. Later I noticed the defunct rails of the tram, emerging defiant here and there from the crude asphalt patches. Like zombies climbing out of the grave, they lay testimony to an older time when the loud  noise of the trams was a part of an otherwise similar scene. It was worrying to see that there were many holes on the street, maybe there would be a new layer of asphalt, surely delivering the killing blow to the last remnants of the rails.

His house was on the corner, standing proud without any good or bad reason to do so, much like him. I rung the bell and waited for the answering voice. To my surprise it came from behind, not from the loudspeaker. I glanced quickly and a tiny lady was standing behind me and asking if I was going to the elder home. I quickly answered no, not wanting to loose the voice I was expecting. "Hello Joaquim, come in. Is it open?" "Are you going to the elder home? It's in the first floor." Yes, no! I held the door open and repeated, "Sophie, I have the door, thank you, I'm coming up". Now I could dedicate my attention to this insisting tiny lady. She was indeed very short, more so because I was a couple of steps above her. She was looking at me behind her glades, not really understanding what was going on but more relieved now that the door was open. "Would you like to come in?" I asked to which she replied by climbing the few steps in front of the door. I held the door open and we walked to the elevator. "Are you going to the elderly home?" she washed again. "I think it's in the first floor. They told me it was in the first floor but I am not sure. Do you know where it is?" I replied that I was visiting some friends, I had no idea there was an elderly home in the building. The elevator arrived and I explained I should get in first because I was the last one to leave. She looked at me in confusion. I repeated louder. She agreed, not really understanding my point. The elevator was tiny, it barely fit the two of us and this lady was as small as they come. The automatic doors started closing, which startled her, since she was close the them. I pulled her back, there was still some room between us. She felt relived. She stepped out saying goodbye and thanking me for the help. I answered back with a merry Christmas, which comforted her.

On the fourth floor, the door to the right was open. I walked in and called for Sophie. She quickly appeared. She was different, less slender and more like a mother. I guess that's normal but she was really different, not big just different. Nature has to adapt a mother before she is able to give birth to twins, I reasoned. I put down my stuff and noticed the house was a complete mess. Right, the twins, they were born recently, they must taken the time out of their parents. Also Armando, my friend, he was not particularly careful with putting things in order. He was my housemate for a few weeks and I remember he was not bothered by the details of order. We went straight to the cradle, which was in the living room. There was a boy and two other women in the room. The lunch table was still there, dirty plates caressing some dry left-over begging to be thrown away, some glasses still had some drink in them but they had long ago lost all hope to serve their purpose. "Are they fake twins?", I asked. "What are fake twins?" asked the boy, while Sophie said yes. She looked at me with a face that clearly said she didn't have patience to answer, so I took the lead. Surely, I was able to explain that concept to a small child, without resorting to the fine details. I was wrong. The kid was more confused than before. His confusion ended swiftly, when his mind saved him by coming up with some interesting plan to do something kids do. The babies were pretty, as far as pretty babies go. Sophie picked the one that was crying, while the other just laid in absolute peace and completely oblivious to the world. Later, just before leaving, I took one last look at him and noticed he hadn't moved a muscle, still in the same position, not bothered by anything. The crying of his bother gave him plenty to be bothered, it sure did to me but I guess that kid is ahead of me.

We went around the house, she was showing me all the rooms, some were less messy than the others. They have an attic, huge and wide. A little girl is on the floor playing with some cards, looks at us with her bright black eyes, inquisitive about this strange man walking up the stairs. There is an opening above the kitchen, making it bright and given a pleasant sense of space. They get to use the attic in exchange for fixing the roof but it's not theirs, although no one else has access to it. Strange arrangement but they have a huge flat and pay less taxes, seems like a good idea. The building, although they renovated everything, insists in letting know his age. He speaks with cracks and moisture, making it clear he's not going to let some people cover his face without a fight. They also took the opportunity to open a balcony, without telling the city hall or the building. The city hall doesn't care but the building didn't like it. He made sure water found it's way into their office, below the balcony. They were forced to open a hole in the ceiling to fix the leak. The hole is still there and the building is still in charge.

We walked back to the living room, where the maid was busy picking the dust. Slowly and inefficiently, it is almost embarrassing to see the lack of deceit. Checking the dust on the cloth, after every swipe, inspecting the result of her little increments of labour. The living room still has a lot of doing before she is free to go home and she knew it. Maybe some miracle would save her from her duty. Before sitting on the sofa, Sophie lets me know about the magazine laying on the sofa. Her husband is on the cover. His company is doing well, he's on top of a flight of stairs, with his employees below, one in each step, all smiling. We talk a little while longer, while the children are playing around, making pleasant noise like children do. They go quiet but we don't notice. Only when the small shadow makes herself silently announced in the corner of our eyes, do we notice the girl standing next to us. She is sad and about to burst into tears, like an old damn trying to hold heavy rain, I watch in amazement as her face begins to break apart, crumbling into pieces, dismantling itself under the weight of her sadness. I expected a cry, one of those wailing shouts, swelling as the tears pour but no. The mouth is open, the face has collapsed but the silence endures. Her arm is stretched since she has arrived, pointing somewhere. The boy enters the room, he is angry. "He bit me in the head!", says the girl. "She is lying!", he shouts. Sophie comforts her and asks what happened. They were playing hide and seek, she went hiding in the green luggage and when she came out, she hit him inadvertently so he took revenge. She says this in-between sobs, still crying. Sophie does her best to make her feel better but it's the TV that takes her mind off the matter and calms her down.

Soon is time for me to get on my way, I am happy to have seen this family and this building.
