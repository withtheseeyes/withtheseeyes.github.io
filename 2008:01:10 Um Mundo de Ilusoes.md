Title: Um Mundo de Ilus√µes

WORLD

The world is the mirror that reflects your own image.

If the world looks cruel, void, empty, irrational you should look carefully into yourself and find the source of this perception that you are projecting into the world.

This is why old traditions call the world the 'illusion', 'samsara' and the like.

You are living in a dream.

Whether it's a nightmare or a pleasant dream it is ultimately your choice.

To find beauty, equilibrium in the world you must nurture it in yourself.

Therefore if you want to find God in the world, you'll have to give birth to It in yourself.

You'll have to become God.

For there is no division between you and any other thing.

Division is part of illusion.

Unity is not.

Unity is God.
