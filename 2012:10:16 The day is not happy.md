Title: The day is not happy
Date: 2012/10/16 9:53

Today I woke up early. It was still night. I couldn't sleep and there's a lot to do. Reason told me to get up and do something with my life. Reason is right and she should shut up more than what she does. The usual follows, stumbling around aimlessly for a while until my brain catches up with the brightness and the reality, reaching out for clothes who would rather be left laying awkwardly on the chair, swallowing wood-chip-cereal with cold milk, brushing the teeth, taking out the garbage, realising it's the wrong day to take out the garbage, grabbing the laptop, heading into the rain. As soon as I step outside, I could see that the day was not happy. He was still sleeping but he was tossing around in bed, entangled in the bed sheets, cold and sweaty. The driving distracts me from the torture the day is going through. Only at the office do I put some attention to it. The day is up by now but he's restless and pacing around, troubled with his fate. The sun is not happy either. The wind is loose and the clouds join the frenzy, dishing out rain as if it was funny. It's not, I tell them but they don't listen to me anymore, I've said this too many times, they no longer take me seriously. I think about the sun, I think about looking at him in search of complicity but I know it's pointless. The clouds are dancing in front of him like a hoard of savage crazed little kids who had too much sugar. He's probably not feeling like sharing this act, so ashamed that he is. I can feel the swamp under my feet giggling, like she always does when she knows she's breaking the spirit of another foreigner, of a allochtoon as she enjoys calling us. I give a tap on the day's shoulder and bury my head on the computer screen, that has kept me going for many years, it will keep me going for a few more. The swamp is not so fond of giggling, at least for a little while.
