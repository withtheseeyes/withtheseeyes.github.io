You are Portuguese and this is your life. You sail. It's what you do. You stepped into this boat and you now sail. You do this because you have no other choice. You are drawn to the difficulties and almost certain death of sailing the high seas because you need to breath. You are pushed away by a suffocating country and culture. The land you leave behind is the safety that spirals into the prison of contempt of just living another day. The seas and hardship of sailing is the incentive you need to unlock all the excitement and fruitfulness you know is within you. The land you are searching for is the unrealistic fantasy of the nation you left behind. You abandon something in search for an idealised version of it, something you know doesn't exist, something you know you'll probably die searching for, something clearly impossible to reach. Yet, you wave goodbye the people, the mountains, the memories, the familiarity, the sun and go. You go in fear of your choice, knowing very well it's probably the most stupid thing you could ever do. You go because it's a cheap trade for the hole you'd call home and learn to appreciate. You go so your dying breath is not a curse to your cowardice. You go because you know it's your path. You go because you see it in the eyes of those you stayed, they would have gone too. You go because you need to miss your home, you feed on the melancholia, it's strengthens you. You go because one day you will come back.

Many things Portuguese people inherently know about themselves but are rarely aware of. You see these things only when you go outside because suddenly they are missing in the foreign people you meet. It is very strange, it's almost surprising to find that void of warmth you took for granted. You see it in the way you give all you've got, while those strangers do it out of duty, commitment, expectation, compromise. It looks fake and superfluous, like they don't believe in what they are doing. That's why they don't fight about it, for them it's just a job; for you it's your sweat and pain, so people better recognise it or not undermine it, at the very least. Give Portugal a common goal and things work, give it freedom to choose one and nothing is accomplished. My goal is certainly more significant than yours, so why are you wasting time on your goal? Things evolve from there very rapidly to a slow simmering self destruction that never ends.

It would be wise for people, portuguese people in particular, to be aware of a few things about Portugal. Portuguese people know these things, they are just rarely aware of them.

The first things about Portugal is that it's identity is grounded on contradiction.

Portugal is eternal. Not in the formal sense of the word but in the cultural sense. The country will die, probably the spanish will take over. I'm amazing they only manage to do it for 60 years, which either speaks much of the portuguese or not so much of the spanish, you pick.

We need leadership. If don't have it, then everyone is the leader, everyone has the best idea to get things done better and everyone else is wrong. Once we get a leader, he is doomed to be replaced. He himself is a portuguese and he also screws up. Either that, or he is killed in battle in north africa and is missed eternally.

It is the people of Portugal who is in charge of the country. Over and over throughout history, this was proven truth. Rulers and ruled, take advantage of this, it is in your best interest.

It's best to accept the contradiction of the portuguese. Those that did, thrived. Those that struggle with it, withered in mediocracy. Most portuguese don't accept it, so mediocracy abounds. This is the first contradiction: we need mediocracy to excel, we need portuguese people to be refuse their identity in order for a few to break out and raise to the challenges of the day. In fact, doesn't really mean that we need mediocracy, it's just an expression of the self-balancing system of the portuguese culture.
